2. The crime rate has a sum totaling up to 1259. 
3. There are 1274 cultures in the United States
4. New Mexico has the highest crime totaling 50 crimes. Other states with high crime rates included; Alaska, Louisiana, and South Carolina
5. Hawaii is the most affordable state
6. Maine has the most favorable weather while North Dakota comes in fifth position
7. Mississippi is the state with the most well-being.
States like Alaska, Louisiana, and South Carolina are not the best to live in after retirement based on their high crime rate. Mississippi, Hawaii, and Maine are the best places to live after retirement because they are affordable, have favorable weather conditions, and high ranking based on well-being.
